### Cooperative

Strengths List, and how do we utilize each of our strengths.
What areas do we want to gain greater strength (for me, practice!! be more comfortable with the code).

During our meeting times we will go over our own code and this wil be a time to explain to each other if one does not understand.

### Conflict Resolution

Communication and respect.
